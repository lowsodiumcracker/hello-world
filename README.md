not really sure yet
Well this is pretty cool just trying to learn the ropes i guess wish me luck. don't really want type this much to tell you the truth and this must be a run on sentence or something because its all angry at me and put a red squigley line underneath of it don't know whats that's all about. well at least I can type pretty fast wow look at me go. Man I'm typing so fast lol. I don't know why there is still a red line under what I am typing.
So is the coding or what when do I start the good stuff.O oops i was typing in the wrong place.
